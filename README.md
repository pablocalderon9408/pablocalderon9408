### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Pablo.

## About me:

 ðŸ”­ Thanks to my work as a process improvement lead, I discover how paasionate I was about software development and data analytics .

With 2 years experience, I feel confident working with Python and Django. Currently studying JavaScript and planning to learn React this year.

âš¡ Disciplined, self-learner, goal oriented, skilled to lead people, accountable and always learning.

I am working for hackU, an educational startup, based on microlearning.

I like to be challenged and surrounded with great people to look up to.
